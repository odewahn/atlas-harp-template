# Atlas Harp template

I've also included the P5 plugin, because p5 is great.  To use it:

* Install [Harp](http://harpjs.com/)

* Create a new project in Atlas
* Click the  the "Advanced" link
* Paste the URL for this template into the "Custom" field
* Click "Create Project"

Atlas will churn away for a while, and then you can edit your project.  Once it's done:

* Clone it to your local machine
* Run `harp server`
* Edit locally in markdown or ejs
* View the files at `localhost:9000`

A few more notes:

* Global settings, like your name or the project name, are in `harp.json`
* Put your TOC and testimonials in `public/_data.json`
